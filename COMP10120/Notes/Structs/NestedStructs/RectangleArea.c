/*
The Task:

Define two structs:

Point: contains int x and int y.

Rectangle: contains two Point structs: topLeft and bottomRight.

Write a function calculateArea(Rectangle *r):

The width is the difference between the x values.

The height is the difference between the y values.

Return the area (width * height).

In main:

Create an array of 3 Rectangles.

Loop through and ask the user for the coordinates of each (e.g., rects[i].topLeft.x).

Print the area of each rectangle.
